# Library-management-system---A-Mini-project-on-SQL-
This project is a Library Management System built using SQL that simulates the operations of a real-world library. It includes schema design, table creation, relationships using foreign keys, and SQL queries for managing book borrowals, members, and inventory. 

**Language: SQL  
Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (Choose your preferred RDBMS)  
Tools: MySQL Workbench / pgAdmin / DB Browser for SQLite**   

# Features

- Normalized relational database (3NF)
- Data integrity using primary and foreign keys
- Simple and efficient table structure
- Real-world simulation of borrow/return system
- Easily extendable for additional features like fines, due dates, returns, etc.

# How to Use

- Clone or download this repository.
- Open the SQL files using your preferred database tool.
- Run schema.sql to create the database tables.
- Insert sample data and run sample_queries.sql to test.
- Extend or build on the system for learning or real use cases.

# Future Enhancements

- Add ReturnDate and overdue fine calculation
- Create views for daily/weekly borrow statistics
- Add stored procedures for issuing/returning books
- Web UI using Python + Flask + SQLite
- Trigger to auto-update AvailableCopies on borrow/return

# Learnings

- Designing relational databases from scratch
- Understanding normalization and table relationships
- Writing robust SQL queries
- Implementing primary/foreign key constraints
- Real-life modeling using data
